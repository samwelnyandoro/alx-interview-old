# 0x16-rotate_2d_matrix
This interview algorithm project rotates a 2D NxN matrix in place without importing modules.

[Rotate 2D Matrix](/0x16-rotate_2d_matrix/0-rotate_2d_matrix)
* Write a function in Python `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` that rotates a 2D NxN matrix 90 degrees clockwise:
  * The Python program cannot import any modules.
  * The Python program cannot return anything.  The matrix must be edited in-place.
  * The matrix can be assumed to have two-dimensions and will not be empty.

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
